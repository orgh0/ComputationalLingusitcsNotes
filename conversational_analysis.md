## 1.Turn Taking

### 1.1 Basic	
* Turn taking is a type of organization in conversation and discourse where the participants speak one at a time in alternating turns 
* Involves process for constructing contributions, responding to previous comments, and transitioning to a different speaker
* While the structure generally universal the conventions of how turns are distributed, transitioning is signalled, or how much overlap is acceptable varies according to the culture

### 1.2 Organization
* Turn Taking Organization describes the set of practises used by speakers to construct and allocate turns
* Turn Taking structure has 3 components:
	- Turn Taking Component : The Turn-taking component contains the main content of the utterance and is built from various unit types called the turn construction unit. The end of a TCU is a point where the turn may end and a new speaker may begin, known as a transition-relevant point or TRP.

	- Turn Allocation Component :  Turn allocation component comprises techniques that select the next speaker. There are two types of techniques: those where the current speaker selects the next speaker, and those where the next speaker selects themself.


	- Turn Construction Rules : Rules govern turn construction and give options to designate the next turn-taker in such a way as to minimize gaps and overlap. Once a Transition Relevance Place is reached, the following rules are applied in order:
		- The current speaker selects the next speaker and transfers the turn to them
		- One of the non-speakers self-selects, with the first person to speak claiming the next turn
		- No one self-selects, and the current speaker continues until the next TRP or the conversation ends

### 1.3 Adjacency Pairs
* An Adjacency Pair is a 2 part exchange in which a second utterance is funtionally dependent on first, as exhibited in conversational greetings, invitations, requests. This concept is also called the concept of nextness
* It's a type of turn-talking

## 2. Preference Organization
* Conversational Analysis may reveal structural (i.e. practice-underwritten) preferences in conversation for some types of actions (within sequences of action) over others.
* For example, responsive actions which agree with, or accept, positions taken by a first action tend to be performed more straightforwardly and faster than actions that disagree with, or decline, those positions.
* The former is termed an unmarked turn shape, meaning the turn is not preceded by silence nor is it produced with delays, mitigation and accounts. The latter is termed marked turn shape, which describes a turn with opposite characteristics. One consequence of this is that agreement and acceptance are promoted over their alternatives, and are more likely to be the outcome of the sequence. Pre-sequences are also a component of preference organization and contribute to this outcome.

## 3. Repair
* Repair is the process by which a speaker recognizes a speech error and repeats what has been said with some sort of correction.  
* A linguistic repair may be marked by a hesitation and an editing term (such as, "I mean") and is sometimes regarded as a type of dysfluency.
* Repairs are variously classified as
* Types of Repair Sequences
	- Self-initiated self-repair: Repair is both initiated and carried out by the speaker  the trouble source.
	- Other-initiated self-repair: Repair is carried out by speaker of the trouble source but initiated by the recipient.
	- Self-initiated other-repair: The speaker of a trouble source may try and get the recipient to repair the trouble--for instance if a name is proving troublesome to remember.
	- Other-initiated other-repair: The recipient of a trouble source turn both initiates and carries out the repair. This is closest to what is conventionally called 'correction.'

## 4. Grounding
*  It comprises the collection of "mutual knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions" that is essential for communication between two people.
* Successful grounding in communication requires parties "to coordinate both the content and process". The concept is also common in philosophy of language.
* Phases in grounding
	The parties engaging in grounding exchange information over what they do or do not understand over the course of a communication and they will continue to clarify concepts until they have agreed on grounding criterion. There are generally two phases in grounding.
	- Presenting utterance - speaker presents utterance to addressee
	- Accepting utterance - addressee accepts utterance by providing evidence of understanding
* Evidence in Conversation
	- Acknowledgements : 'yeah', un-huh', 'really'
	- Relevant next turn : initiation or invitation to respond between speakers, including verbal and nonverbal prompts for turn-taking in conversation 
	- Continued Attention : Continued attention is the "mutual belief that addressees have correctly identified a referent." Partners involved in a conversation usually demonstrate this through eye gaze.

## Dialouge Acts
* A dialog act is a specialized Speech act. For example, Question is a speech act, but Question_on_hotel is a dialog act. Dialog acts are different in different dialog systems. 
* List Of Dialouge Acts:
	- Generic (speech acts)
		- greetings
		- Meta Question: "What can I say?"
		- Yes-No Question
		- Statement
		- Request
		- Wh-Question
	- Domain Specific
* Identify a dialog Act:
	- Script Based Method
	- Learning Based Method
